## What you should install?

For this project, I decided to use Express.js, Node.js and JSON Web Tokens.

## Download

You can download the folder on my [GitHub](https://github.com/samaronybarros/) or you can do this directly on [this link](https://github.com/samaronybarros/jwt-app).

If you have git installed on your PC, you just need do as follow:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/samaronybarros/jwt-app.git
```

## Setting up the App

If you have all the prerequisites installed you should verify if your MongoDB is up.

```
$ cd jwt-app
$ cd server
$ yarn install
$ nodemon index.js
```
